# Luke's Pi-hole Blocklist

This is my personal Pi-hole blocklist. I keep it here so that I can manage it outside of Pi-hole admin panel.

Production URL: [https://pihole.lukem.net/hosts.txt](https://pihole.lukem.net/hosts.txt)

To learn what Pi-hole is, visit [https://pi-hole.net/](https://pi-hole.net/).

The list can also be used with AdBlock, uBlock Origin and other compatible ad-blocking extensions.

I spent time to tailor the list to the way I use my computing devices. Before using it please bear in mind it's very heavily opinionated. I may deliberately block well-known sites for my own reasons. You may or may not agree with my choices.

Should you have any questions, visit [https://www.lukaszwojcik.net/](https://www.lukaszwojcik.net/) to learn how to get in touch with me.
