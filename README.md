This is a personal blacklist for my home Pi-hole deployment. I keep it here so that I can manage it outside of Pi-hole admin panel.

To learn what Pi-hole is, visit [https://pi-hole.net/](https://pi-hole.net/).

I spent time to tailor the blacklist to the way I use my computing devices. If you feel like using it, please bear in mind it's very heavily opinionated. I deliberately block numerous well-known sites inside my home network to decrease time spent on distractions as well as to reduce certain security and privacy concerns. You may or may not agree with my choices.
